## Daniel
(a) Tuesdays 3:30-5:30?
(b) My individual goal for this project is to draw meaningful conclusions from Kaggle datasets, since Iâ€™m interested in data science competitions. My role is to collect and clean data pertaining to the starting salary of graduate students and their region in the United States. Additionally, I will generate and publish my results, including data visualizations.
(c) I will communicate weekly via a group chat created on Messenger.
(d) I will give feedback when there is an issue or a difference of opinion. Communication problems will be addressed by talking in person. If communication and work continues to break down, I will escalate the case to my T.A.
